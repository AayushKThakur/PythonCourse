#  variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. 
# A variable is essentially a name that is assigned to a value. Unlike many other programming languages, Python variables do not require explicit declaration of type. 
# The type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned.

# Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores (_).
# A variable name cannot start with a digit.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, else, for) as variable names.

# a-z, A-Z, _ :starting of a variable name
#further can contain numbers digits and underscore, no special characters
